a) Passing a arguments by value creates a copy within the scope of the function and any changes
made to the value does not affect the original variable value, while passing by reference does not
create a new copy and any changes made to it within the function scope affects the original
variable value.

b) The rand function generates a random number between 0 and RAND_MAX which is at least
32767, it is defined in the <stdlib.h> header.

c) A program can be randomized by passing a seed value before calling the rand function the current
time would be used as the seed value, the value produced by the rand function can be scaled by
finding the modulus of the returned number with the scaling factor, shifting can be achieved
by adding the amount we want to shift to the number produced by rand.

d) A recursive function is a function that calls itself and a base case is the condition to be met
in a recursive function to stop its recursion thus allowing the function to produce a result.
